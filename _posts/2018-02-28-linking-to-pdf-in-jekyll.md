To make a pdf downloadable directly, place your pdf where you want it to be,
say assets folder. Insert the code below anywhere on your page. Voil√†,
{% highlight markdown %}
you can [download pdf]({{ site.url }}/assets/mydoc.pdf) here.
{% endhighlight %}

An alternative is to have your pdf displayed on a Github webpage along with
other content (check my CV page).

* Make the static website/repository in Github: username.github.io
* If you already have a website, create a new static page
* Place your pdf where you want it to be (also root would do)
* Embed your pdf file:
{% highlight markdown %}
<embed src="https://username.github.io/mydoc.pdf" type="application/pdf"/>
{% endhighlight %}
