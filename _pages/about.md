Hi! My background (and PhD) is in Economics and in particular Macroeconomic Modeling.
But working as an Analyst for a Business Intelligence company, I became very excited about firm-level data as well. I have quite a bit of experience in data analysis and forecasting, revenue management, e-commerce systems, and developing analytics for BI software for Italian ski resorts. I like working in R (big fan of Tidyverse) and learning new techy things. My most recent discovery is Jekyll, which is responsible for this website being up and running.
You can find out more information using my personal assistant
