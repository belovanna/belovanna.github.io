Hi! My background (and PhD) is in Economics and in particular Macroeconomic Modeling.
But working as an Analyst for a Business Intelligence company, I became very excited about firm-level data as well. I have quite a bit of experience in data analysis and forecasting, revenue management, e-commerce systems, and developing analytics for BI software for Italian ski resorts. I like working in R (big fan of Tidyverse) and learning new techy things. My most recent discovery is Jekyll, which is responsible for this website being up and running.

### Education:
- **University of Trento** (2011 - 2016)   
  PhD in Economics
- **Lund University** (2008 - 2010)   
  MSc in Economics
